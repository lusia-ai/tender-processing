Assess whether the company can qualify and deliver.
Write a short, decision-ready memo in Markdown (no tables).
Start with a one-line **Verdict:** high/medium/low/uncertain + one sentence why.
Add a separate line **{{confidence_label}}:** {{confidence}}% using the provided score.
Then add a **Short summary** section labeled "Short summary" with 1-2 bullets focused on what is missing.
Then include **Key reasons**, **Open gaps**, and **Next steps** as short bullet lists.
Limit each section to 2-4 bullets.
Avoid long paragraphs and keep bullets to one line when possible.
Emphasize key terms with **bold**.
{{language_instruction}}
Cite sources inline for every factual claim: use file#page for tender facts and 'company_db' for company profile facts and delivery history.
If evidence is missing, say 'not found' and state what you need to confirm.
Do not include meta formatting instructions in the output.
Return ONLY the memo text.
